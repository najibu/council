# Forum 

## 1 Setup
1. Thread
2. Reply
3. User 

A. Thread is created by a user.
B. A reply belongs to a thread, and belongs to a user. 

# tinker creating threads and replies
$threads = factory(‘App\Thread’, 50)->create();
$threads->each(function($thread){ factory(‘App\Reply’, 10)->create([’thread_id’ => $thread->id]); });

## 2 Test Driving threads
First small feature: "a user should be able to read threads." Simple enough! We'll start with a basic test, and then scaffold the necessary views to make it pass.

## 3 A Thread Can Have Replies
 Given we have a thread
 And that thread includes replies
 When we visit a thread page
 Then we should see the replies.

an_authenticated_user_may_participate_in_forum_threads
Given we have an authenitcated user 
And an existing thread
When the user adds a reply to the thread
Then their reply should be included on the page.
